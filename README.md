# Halloween Zoetrope

## Description

My submission for the warp-2023 hackathon.

Going for the "Wow!-Track" I wanted to try out an optical illusion and opted for a zoetrope which sparked my interest during the conception phase. It's an old animation device dating prior to film and most were made in 2D.
Using 12 different poses/variations for the 3D models and positioning them precisely along a circle, the needed rotation speed for the illusion can be calculated by Math.PI/6. As soon as this speed is achieved, the 12 frames seem to play like an animation.

Fitting to the season, I decided to make my entry Halloween themed. Hope you enjoy!
